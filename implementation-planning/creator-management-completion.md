## üéØ Next Priority Items

1. **Fix linter errors** in test files
2. **Add CSRF protection** to creator endpoints
3. **Complete integration tests** for all API endpoints
4. **Implement real template preview** rendering
5. **Add bulk actions** for template management

## üìä Current Status

- **Core Features**: 95% Complete
- **API Integration**: 90% Complete  
- **Testing**: 70% Complete
- **Security**: 60% Complete
- **UI Polish**: 80% Complete

## üîß Technical Debt

- Missing comprehensive error handling
- No audit trail for template changes

## üìù Notes

- Creator role system is fully functional
- All major UI components are implemented
- API endpoints are working with proper validation
- Need to focus on testing and security hardening
- Template preview needs real implementation
