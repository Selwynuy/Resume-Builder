# Product Requirements Document: Critical UX Fixes

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD addresses critical user experience issues that are currently affecting the Resume Builder application. The problems include broken AI suggestion functionality, non-functional delete buttons, missing template loading when editing resumes, and poor loading state feedback throughout the application. These fixes are essential for maintaining user trust and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Goals

1. **Fix AI Suggestion Functionality**: Ensure all AI suggestion features work consistently with proper loading states
2. **Implement Functional Delete Buttons**: Create working delete functionality for resumes and templates with proper user feedback
3. **Enable Template Loading on Edit**: Automatically load and apply the correct template when editing resumes
4. **Add Global Loading States**: Implement comprehensive loading feedback for all user interactions
5. **Improve Overall UX**: Eliminate user confusion and provide clear feedback for all actions

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want AI suggestions to work consistently across all resume sections so that I can get help improving my content without frustration.

2. **As a user**, I want to be able to delete my resumes and templates from the dashboard so that I can manage my content effectively.

3. **As a user**, I want my selected template to automatically load when editing a resume so that I can see the correct formatting immediately.

4. **As a user**, I want clear loading indicators for all actions so that I know when the system is processing my requests.

5. **As a user**, I want consistent UI feedback for all interactions so that I can trust the application is working correctly.

- **5.2** Ensure all buttons have proper hover and focus states
- **5.3** Implement consistent error message styling
- **5.4** Add success message feedback for all operations
- **5.5** Ensure all interactive elements have proper accessibility attributes

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Redesigning the entire UI/UX system
- Adding new AI features beyond fixing existing ones
- Implementing advanced template management features
- Adding new resume sections or fields
- Implementing real-time collaboration features
- Adding advanced analytics or reporting

## Design Considerations

### AI Suggestion Modal Design
- Use consistent modal styling across all AI features
- Implement skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
- Show clear error messages with retry options
- Use monochrome FontAwesome icons as per user preference
- Ensure modal is responsive and accessible

### Loading State Design
- Use consistent spinner/skeleton components
- Implement progressive loading for better UX
- Show loading text that describes the current action
- Use subtle animations to indicate activity
- Ensure loading states don't block user interaction unnecessarily

### Delete Button Design
- Use consistent red styling for delete actions
- Implement confirmation dialogs with clear messaging
- Show immediate visual feedback on hover/click
- Use appropriate icons (Trash2 from Lucide React)
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment with other buttons

## Technical Considerations

### AI Modal Implementation
- Create a shared `AISuggestionModal` component
- Use React Context for managing AI suggestion state
- Implement proper error boundaries for AI API calls
- Cache AI suggestions to improve performance
- Use proper TypeScript types for all AI-related data

### Delete Button Implementation
- Create `DeleteResumeButton` component with 'use client' directive
- Implement proper error handling for delete API calls
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Ensure proper cleanup of related data
- Handle edge cases (network errors, permission issues)

### Template Loading Implementation
- Fetch template data on resume edit page load
- Implement proper error handling for missing templates
- Use React Query or similar for efficient data fetching
- Cache template data to reduce API calls
- Handle template versioning if needed

### Global Loading Implementation
- Use React Context for global loading state
- Implement loading state management hooks
- Use Next.js loading.tsx files for page-level loading
- Implement proper loading state cleanup
- Ensure loading states don't interfere with user interactions

## Success Metrics

1. **AI Suggestion Success Rate**: 95% of AI suggestion requests should complete successfully
2. **Delete Operation Success Rate**: 100% of delete operations should work without errors
3. **Template Loading Success Rate**: 100% of resume edits should load the correct template
4. **User Satisfaction**: Reduce user-reported bugs by 80%
5. **Loading State Coverage**: 100% of user interactions should have appropriate loading feedback
6. **Error Rate Reduction**: Reduce application errors by 70%

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a more sophisticated AI suggestion caching system?
2. Do we need to add undo functionality for delete operations?
3. Should we implement template versioning for better compatibility?
4. Do we need to add more granular loading states for different types of operations?
5. Should we implement offline support for basic operations?

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Fix AI suggestion functionality and delete buttons
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement template loading for edit resume
3. **Medium Priority**: Add global loading states
4. **Low Priority**: Remove unnecessary UI elements and polish

## Dependencies

- Existing AI API endpoints must remain functional
- Resume and template data models must support template associations
- Next.js routing system for navigation loading states
- Existing authentication system for delete permissions
- Current UI component library for consistent styling
