# Product Requirements Document: Template Creator Management Page

## Introduction/Overview

Create a dedicated template creator management page that allows users with creator roles to manage their submitted templates. This page will provide a comprehensive dashboard for creators to view, edit, and track their templates with full analytics and approval status tracking. The page will be separate from the main dashboard and only accessible to users with creator privileges.

## Goals

1. **Template Management**: Provide creators with a centralized location to manage all their submitted templates
2. **Status Tracking**: Show real-time approval status (approved, pending, rejected) for each template
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Display comprehensive statistics including downloads, ratings, and performance metrics
4. **Template Actions**: Enable creators to edit, delete, and manage their templates
5. **Access Control**: Ensure only users with creator roles can access this functionality
6. **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive table-based interface with sorting and filtering capabilities

## User Stories

1. **As a template creator**, I want to see all my created templates in a table format so that I can easily manage them
2. **As a template creator**, I want to see the approval status of each template so that I know which ones are live and which need attention
3. **As a template creator**, I want to view analytics for each template so that I can understand their performance
4. **As a template creator**, I want to edit my templates so that I can improve them based on feedback
5. **As a template creator**, I want to see rejection reasons for rejected templates so that I can fix issues
6. **As a template creator**, I want to sort and filter my templates by various criteria so that I can find specific templates quickly
7. **As a template creator**, I want to access the template creation page from this management page so that I can create new templates
8. **As a normal user**, I should not be able to access this page so that the creator functionality remains exclusive

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- Table-based design similar to admin page layout

- Clean, professional interface matching existing design system
- Sortable table headers with visual indicators
- Filter dropdowns and search bar
- Action buttons for each template row
- Loading states and error handling

### Layout Structure
- Header with page title and "Create New Template" button
- Filter and search controls
- Main table with template data
- Pagination for large template lists
- Empty state design for users with no templates

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing authentication system
- Must use existing template model and API endpoints
- Must integrate with approval workflow from admin page
- Should reuse existing UI components where possible
- Must implement proper role-based access control

### Performance Requirements
- Fast loading of template data
- Efficient sorting and filtering
- Optimized database queries
- Proper caching for analytics data

### Security Requirements
- Role-based access control
- Input validation for all user actions
- CSRF protection for form submissions
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: 80% of creators visit the page at least once per week
2. **Template Management**: 90% of creators successfully edit/update their templates
3. **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating for creator experience
4. **Performance**: Page load time under 2 seconds
5. **Error Rate**: Less than 1% error rate for template operations

## Open Questions

1. What specific creator role system should be implemented? (Database field, separate collection, etc.)
2. Should there be limits on how many templates a creator can have?
3. What analytics data should be real-time vs. cached?
4. Should creators be able to withdraw templates from approval?
5. What should happen to rejected templates - can they be resubmitted?
6. Should there be a creator application process for normal users?
7. What level of analytics detail should be shown to creators?
8. Should there be notifications for status changes?
