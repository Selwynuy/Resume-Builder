# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Codebase Refactor & Production Hardening

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This project aims to refactor and optimize the Resume Builder codebase to ensure it is clean, maintainable, modular, and production-ready. The goal is to make the codebase easy for junior developers to understand and extend, eliminate technical debt, enforce best practices, and prepare for a robust public launch. The refactor will be performed module-by-module, with thorough testing and validation at each step.

## 2. Goals

- Eliminate unused code, linter errors, and code smells across the codebase.
- Modularize code into atomic components, hooks, and utilities for reusability and clarity.
- Adopt a modern, maintainable file structure (components, hooks, lib, auth, middleware, etc.).
- Enforce strict TypeScript and linting rules (ESLint + Prettier, Airbnb style).
- Use absolute imports for maintainability.
- Integrate a modern component library (e.g., shadcn/ui or Chakra UI) for UI consistency.
- Apply best rendering strategies (SSR/CSR/SSG) per page for performance and SEO.
- Centralize authentication logic in a dedicated folder.
- Apply security best practices to avoid common vulnerabilities.
- Achieve 100% test coverage using Jest.
- Provide comprehensive documentation (code, onboarding, architecture, deployment, API docs).
- Ensure all changes are non-breaking and the app works after each refactor step.

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to easily find and understand code modules so I can quickly make changes or add features.
- As a developer, I want to see clear, actionable linter errors and type errors so I can fix issues before they reach production.
- As a developer, I want to reuse atomic UI components to keep the UI consistent and avoid duplication.
- As a developer, I want to see 100% test coverage so I can refactor with confidence.
- As a product owner, I want the codebase to be secure and follow best practices to protect user data.
- As a new team member, I want onboarding and architecture docs so I can get up to speed quickly.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must remove all unused code, dead files, and linter errors.
2. The system must modularize code into atomic components, hooks, and utilities.
3. The system must use a modern, maintainable file structure (components, hooks, lib, auth, middleware, etc.).
4. The system must enforce strict TypeScript mode and use ESLint + Prettier (Airbnb style).
5. The system must use absolute imports throughout the codebase.
6. The system must integrate a modern component library (e.g., shadcn/ui or Chakra UI) for all UI elements.
7. The system must use SSR/CSR/SSG as appropriate for each page (e.g., SSG for landing, SSR for dashboard, CSR for builder).
8. The system must centralize all authentication logic in a dedicated folder.
9. The system must implement security best practices (e.g., input validation, CSRF protection, secure headers, rate limiting).
10. The system must achieve and maintain 100% test coverage using Jest.
11. The system must provide a /documentation folder with code docs, onboarding, architecture, deployment, and (if possible) auto-generated API docs.
12. The system must ensure all changes are non-breaking and the app works after each refactor step.
13. The system must update the .gitignore file as needed to avoid committing sensitive or build files.
14. The system must review the .env file for secrets and best practices.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- No new features or business logic changes (focus is on refactor, not feature development).
- No deployment or infrastructure changes (unless required for code structure).
- No changes to the .env file format or deployment targets.
- No integration of payment or monetization features at this stage.

## 6. Design Considerations

- Use atomic design principles for UI components.
- Adopt a consistent, modern UI library (shadcn/ui or Chakra UI recommended).
- Ensure all pages are responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names.
- Provide code comments and JSDoc where helpful.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Use ESLint + Prettier with Airbnb config for linting/formatting.
- Enforce TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig.json.
- Use absolute imports (e.g., @/components/Component).
- Use Jest for all unit and integration tests.
- Use Next.js best practices for SSR/CSR/SSG.
- Centralize authentication in /auth or /authenticate.
- Add a /middleware folder for custom middleware (e.g., auth, logging, rate limiting).
- Add a /documentation folder for all docs.
- Use auto-generated API docs if feasible (e.g., Swagger for REST endpoints).

## 8. Success Metrics

- 0 linter errors and 0 unused code warnings.
- 100% test coverage (Jest).
- All tests pass after each refactor step.
- Codebase is modular, atomic, and easy to navigate.
- All pages render and function as expected after refactor.
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date.

## 9. Open Questions

- Which component library (shadcn/ui or Chakra UI) is preferred after initial evaluation?
- Are there any legacy features or code that should be flagged for future removal?
- Should we add automated CI checks for linting, testing, and coverage before merging PRs?
- Any specific security tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to integrate?

**Next Steps:**
- Review this PRD and confirm or suggest changes.
- Once confirmed, begin module-by-module refactor, starting with the most critical or highest-impact area.
