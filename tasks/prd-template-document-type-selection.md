# PRD: Template Document Type Selection

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds document type selection capabilities to the template creation process, allowing creators to specify which document type(s) their template is designed for. This addresses multiple problems: improves template categorization, enhances user discovery, enables better filtering, ensures proper template usage, and provides better organization for template management.

The goal is to create a comprehensive document type system that benefits both template creators and end users while maintaining backward compatibility with existing templates.

## Goals

1. **Template Categorization**: Enable creators to properly categorize their templates by document type
2. **User Discovery**: Improve template discovery and filtering for end users
3. **Template Compatibility**: Ensure templates are used for appropriate document types
4. **Management Efficiency**: Provide better organization and management of templates
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain functionality for existing templates without document types
6. **Multi-Type Support**: Allow templates to support multiple document types when applicable

## User Stories

1. **As a template creator**, I want to specify which document type(s) my template supports so that users can find it when looking for specific document types.

2. **As a template creator**, I want to create templates that work for multiple document types so that I can maximize the reach of my designs.

3. **As an end user**, I want to filter templates by document type so that I can quickly find templates suitable for my specific needs.

4. **As an end user**, I want to see which document type a template supports so that I can make informed decisions about template selection.

5. **As an admin**, I want to manage templates by document type so that I can better organize and approve templates.

6. **As a system**, I want to automatically filter templates based on document type so that users see relevant options in the resume builder.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Document Type Selection Interface**: The system must provide a document type selection interface in the template creation advanced options/settings.

2. **Required Field Validation**: The system must require creators to select at least one document type before template submission.

3. **Multiple Document Type Support**: The system must allow creators to select multiple document types for a single template.

4. **Document Type Options**: The system must provide the following document type options: Resume, CV, and Biodata.

5. **Template Filtering**: The system must filter templates on the templates page based on selected document type.

6. **Template Selection Integration**: The system must integrate document type filtering in the resume builder template selection process.

7. **Search Functionality**: The system must include document type in template search functionality.

8. **Approval Workflow Integration**: The system must include document type information in the template approval workflow.

9. **Backward Compatibility**: The system must maintain full functionality for existing templates without document type assignments.

10. **Template Display**: The system must display document type badges on template cards and previews.

11. **Template Editing**: The system must allow creators to modify document type selections when editing existing templates.

12. **Admin Management**: The system must provide admin tools to view and manage templates by document type.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Document Types**: This feature will not allow creators to define custom document types beyond the predefined options.

2. **Document Type Templates**: This feature will not provide different template structures based on document type.

3. **Automatic Document Type Detection**: The system will not automatically detect document types from template content.

4. **Document Type Migration**: The system will not automatically assign document types to existing templates.

5. **Document Type Analytics**: This feature will not include analytics or reporting on document type usage.

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

1. **Template Creation Flow**: Document type selection should be placed in the "Advanced Options" or "Settings" section of template creation.

2. **Selection Interface**: Use checkboxes or multi-select dropdown for document type selection to support multiple selections.

3. **Visual Indicators**: Display document type badges on template cards with appropriate color coding:
   - Resume: Blue badge
   - CV: Purple badge  
   - Biodata: Green badge

4. **Filtering Interface**: Add document type filter to the templates page with clear visual feedback.

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure document type selection and filtering works on mobile devices.

### Component Integration

- Integrate with existing `TemplateSelector` component
- Update `TemplatePreview` component to show document type badges
- Modify template creation forms to include document type selection
- Update admin template management interfaces

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates

1. **Template Model**: Add `supportedDocumentTypes` field to Template model as an array of DocumentType enum values.

2. **API Endpoints**: Update template creation, editing, and retrieval endpoints to handle document type data.

3. **Validation**: Implement server-side validation to ensure at least one document type is selected.

### Integration Points

1. **Existing Auth Module**: Ensure document type selection respects user permissions and creator roles.

2. **Template Rendering**: Update template rendering logic to consider document type context.

3. **Search Index**: Include document type in search indexing for better discovery.

4. **Caching**: Update cache invalidation strategies to handle document type changes.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Filtering Performance**: Optimize database queries for document type filtering.
2. **Search Performance**: Ensure document type inclusion doesn't significantly impact search speed.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain performance for templates without document types.

## Success Metrics

1. **Template Adoption**: 90% of new templates have document types assigned within 30 days of feature launch.

2. **User Engagement**: 25% increase in template discovery and usage through improved filtering.

3. **Template Organization**: 50% reduction in template management overhead for admins.

4. **User Satisfaction**: Improved user feedback scores for template discovery and selection process.

5. **Template Quality**: 30% reduction in support tickets related to template compatibility issues.

## Open Questions

1. **Default Behavior**: Should templates without document types be treated as "universal" templates that work for all document types, or should they be filtered out of document type-specific searches?

2. **Template Migration**: Should we provide a bulk migration tool for admins to assign document types to existing templates?

3. **Document Type Expansion**: Should we plan for future document types (like Cover Letter, Portfolio) in the initial implementation?

4. **Template Validation**: Should we implement any validation to ensure template content aligns with the selected document type?

5. **Analytics Integration**: Should we track which document types are most popular for template creation and usage?

6. **Internationalization**: Should document type labels be translatable for future internationalization efforts?

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority:**
- Document type selection in template creation
- Template filtering on templates page
- Backward compatibility maintenance

**Medium Priority:**
- Admin management tools
- Search integration
- Template editing capabilities

**Low Priority:**
- Analytics and reporting
- Bulk migration tools
- Advanced validation features
