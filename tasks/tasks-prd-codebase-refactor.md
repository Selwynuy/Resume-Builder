## Relevant Files

- `src/components/` - All UI components, to be modularized and refactored into atomic components.
- `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks, to be cleaned up and organized.
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic.
- `src/auth/` or `src/authenticate/` - Centralized authentication logic.
- `src/middleware/` - Middleware for auth, logging, rate limiting, etc.
- `src/documentation/` - All documentation (code, onboarding, architecture, deployment, API docs).
- `src/pages/` or `src/app/` - Main Next.js pages, to be optimized for SSR/CSR/SSG as appropriate.
- `jest.config.js` and all `*.test.ts(x)` files - For 100% test coverage.
- `.gitignore` - To be updated for sensitive/build files.
- `.env` - To be reviewed for secrets and best practices.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- **ESLint was run on the codebase. There are errors and warnings to address in the next sub-tasks.**
